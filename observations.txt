From the EIA-923 instructions:

Net Generation: is the gross generation minus
the electric energy consumed at the generating station for pumps, fans, and
auxiliary equipment. If the monthly station service load exceeded the monthly
gross electrical generation, report negative electrical net generation with a
minus sign.

The following comments regard data for 2015:

############
# Heat Rates

When filtering for plants with capacity factor <= -0.05, only 6 plants remain
(55 months total with negative heat rates).
- 2 are ST that belong to industrial production facilities, so negative net
generation is not unexpected
- 3 are IC engines that have negative values for only some months. They may be
part of industrial production facilities, but the names are obscure
- 1 is a ST belonging to a cogen facility, which may have required additional
electricity those few months to meet its heat demand

There are 2074 months (~300 plants) of negative heat rate records.
- Most of the records are very low negative capacity factor values (way
smaller than -1%). Those months are of really low net electricity generation.
Prime movers are varied.
- Only 125 records consider negative net generation greater than -1000 MWh
(operating aprox at 1-2 MW of consumption per hour)
- Only 1 cogen plant presents noticeable negative heat rates.

Cogen plants have mostly reasonable (even low) heat rates. A significant
portion have high heat rates (15-20 MMBTU/MWh), but these are consistent with
months of high capacity factors (they must indeed be inefficient).

# Hydro cf

There are 202 records in which capacity factors (and net generation) were
negative for standard turbines (NOT pumped storage).
- 24 plants have negative records for more than 1 month
- Only 15 records (2 plants) are negative values greater than -1%
- Extreme cases: The Tule River plant accounts for the most extreme negative
values (between -2 and -5%), but some quick online research yielded photos
with the canals completely dry in 2015 due to the drought, so it is a
resonable value. The Big Creek plants are a similar case. Both are also
100-year old plants.
