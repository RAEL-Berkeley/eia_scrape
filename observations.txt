From the EIA-923 instructions:

Net Generation: is the gross generation minus
the electric energy consumed at the generating station for pumps, fans, and
auxiliary equipment. If the monthly station service load exceeded the monthly
gross electrical generation, report negative electrical net generation with a
minus sign.

The following comments regard data for 2015:

# Heat Rates

When filtering for plants with capacity factor <= -0.05, only 6 plants remain
(55 months total with negative heat rates).
- 2 are ST that belong to industrial production facilities, so negative net
generation is not unexpected
- 3 are IC engines that have negative values for only some months. They may be
part of industrial production facilities, but the names are obscure
- 1 is a ST belonging to a cogen facility, which may have required additional
electricity those few months to meet its heat demand

There are 2074 months (~300 plants) of negative heat rate records.
- Most of the records are very low negative capacity factor values (way
smaller than -1%). Those months are of really low net electricity generation.
Prime movers are varied.
- Only 125 records consider negative net generation greater than -1000 MWh
(operating aprox at 1-2 MW of consumption per hour)
- Only 1 cogen plant presents noticeable negative heat rates.

Cogen plants have mostly reasonable (even low) heat rates. A significant
portion have high heat rates (15-20 MMBTU/MWh), but these are consistent with
months of high capacity factors (they must indeed be inefficient).

Plants with consistently negative heat rates in a year are removed from the
heat rate output tables and the list is stored in a file for inspection.
Careful: These plants are still listed in the generation projects output table.
A list of plants that use multiple fuels is also stored in a separate file
(though these records are not eliminated from the output table).

To be noted: If a plant is listed in the EIA860 as using more than one fuel (as
is the case with a lot of plants that have units that use different fuels
each), then the generation/consumption data will be correctly computed. If, on
the other hand, the plant is only listed as using one main fuel, then its
generation/consumption data will only get calculated for that fuel. So, this
plant will probably appear in the multi-fuel plant list with only one listed
fuel. A similar thing happens if a plant uses two fuels, but has negative heat
rates with one of them. These plants should be inspected manually to determine
the course of action.

# Hydro cf

There are 202 records in which capacity factors (and net generation) were
negative for standard turbines (NOT pumped storage).
- 24 plants have negative records for more than 1 month
- Only 15 records (2 plants) are negative values greater than -1%
- Extreme cases: The Tule River plant accounts for the most extreme negative
values (between -2 and -5%), but some quick online research yielded photos
with the canals completely dry in 2015 due to the drought, so it is a
resonable value. The Big Creek plants are a similar case. Both are also
100-year old plants.
